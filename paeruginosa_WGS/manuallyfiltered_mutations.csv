intergenic(+26/+56),clpA/PA14_RS12325,,"low coverage, ends, inconsistent 100","# low coverage means that there are less than 10 reads at mapping to this position, rendering frequency predictions less accurate and suggesting reads may map poorly to this region"
,PA14_RS00005/PA14_RS29895,,denotes failed breseq run for a population,"# inconsistent means it doesn't happen in consecutive days of the same population, making us less confident that this mutation is real"
G165G(GGCGGG),PA14_RS00110,threonylcarbamoylAMP synthase,"low coverage, ends, inconsistent 100","# inconsistent 100 means that it occurs inconsistently AND at only 100% or 0%, never intermediate frequencies, often interfering with the trajectories of mutations that were confirmed real by clonal WGS and phenotyping"
